/* Challenge #16: Word Frequency Counter
Difficulty: ðŸŸ  Medium
Points: 20

Task: Write a function that takes a string and returns a Map
where each key is a unique word in the string and its value
is the count of occurrences of that word.

Requirements:

Define a function called wordFrequency.
It should take a single string argument.
Return a Map where keys are unique words and values are counts.

Example:
wordFrequency("hello world hello everyone");
// Map { "hello" => 2, "world" => 1, "everyone" => 1 } */

function wordFrequency(str: string): Map<any, any> {
    const map = new Map();
    let count = 1;

    str.split(" ").forEach((word) => {
        map.set(word, () => {
            {
                word, count === 0 ? 1 : count++;
            }
        });
    });

    return map.get(count);
}

console.log(wordFrequency("hello world hello everyone"));
